This is a collection of code snippets I've found useful.

Most relate to linux, MySQL, MSSQL, SugarCRM, Act!, Alfresco or the maintainence of [SugarCRM][sugarcrm], [Act!][act] or [Alfresco][alfresco] as they are two of the primary products I work with on a day to day basis.

Feel free to use these, however no warranty or promise is made other than that reading this page will take up some of your time.
